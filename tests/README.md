# Tests Folder

This folder contains test data for the **Web Crawler** program, generated when running the following command:

```bash
./crawler https://engineering.ucsc.edu/ tests 10
```

### Overview

The test data in this folder represents the output of the web crawler as it processes the specified website. The crawler fetches and stores webpages, saving the HTML content into files for further analysis.

### Note on Incomplete Data

Please be aware that not all test files were uploaded as this is meant to just be an example folder. The files present in this folder are just some files that I uploaded in order to demonstrate what the output of the program is. As a result, the folder may not represent the complete set of crawled data.

### Purpose of the Test Files

Each file in this folder provides an example of the type of information that the crawler is able to extract from a website. These test files include the raw HTML content retrieved by the crawler, showcasing the depth and breadth of its crawling capabilities.

If additional test files are needed or if you'd like to generate new data, simply run the web crawler using the command provided above.
